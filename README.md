# 🍿 The Cinema Booking Web
*Built by hand, fueled by caffeine and no vibe coding*

Welcome to a piece of my personal history! 

It’s humble, it’s trivial, but it’s living proof that I once started and survived my programming journey without AI.

## 🎓 Why is this here?

It might be just another repo on Github, but it’s the project that taught me how to code.

## 🖥️ Really about this project

I built this with pure MVC Servlets and Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS. No frameworks, just sweat and tears.

It contains heavy traces of "First Project Energy" and several hundred lines of CSS and JS that I am too scared to touch now. 

## ✨ Features

This project includes basically every core feature of a cinema booking website you could think of, except for the popcorn.
